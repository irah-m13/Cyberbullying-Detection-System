#  Cyberbullying Detection Framework

Cyberbullying is a serious issue that has negative effects on its victims, and the damage is amplified due to the widespread use of Information Technologies. Therefore, early detection of cyberbullying in social networks becomes crucial to mitigate the impact on the victims. In this project, we propose a framework that uses NLP and Artificial Intelligence to detect abusive words and fake profiles, respectively.

Project Goals:                                                                                                  

   Track abusive words using NLP and Artificial Intelligence                                                                                       
   Detect fake profile use and block the respective websites                                                                                    
   Collect abusive dataset and pre-process using NLP tool                                                                                    
   Classify the category using Machine learning algorithm                                                                                    
   Detect the fake profile using swift Algorithm                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                               
Project Description:                                                                                                                        

The abusive words and primary profile of the user are collected as a dataset and preprocessed using NLP and OpenCV, respectively. The machine learning training is performed to classify the abusive dataset, and the input image is compared with the trained model file. The primary profile picture is compared with the database using the Swift algorithm to detect fake profile users. KNN makes predictions just-in-time by calculating the similarity between an input sample and each training instance.
                                                                                                                                                               
The final technique is to detect fake profile use by scanning the primary user picture with other accounts using the Swift algorithm. Once the fake usage is detected, the particular website of the respective system is blocked using the Selenium tool.
                                                                                                                                                               
In an era of internet and social networking, this framework simplifies the hectic task of cyberbully detection. The proposed system works on the detection of cyberbully in image, video, and audio from social networks. The detection of cyberbully words will be classified, and this proposed framework shows better results while the action is to stop online users from becoming the victims of cyberbully.
